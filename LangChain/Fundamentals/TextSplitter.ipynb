Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37].

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Abilities'}, page_content='First published Tue Jan 26, 2010; substantive revision Tue Apr 22, 2025  \\nIn the accounts we give of one another, claims about our appear to be indispensable. Some abilities are so\\nwidespread that many who have them take them for granted, such as the\\nability to walk, or to write one’s name, or to tell a hawk from\\na handsaw. Others are comparatively rare and notable, such as the\\nability to hit a Major League fastball, or to compose a symphony, or\\nto tell an elm from a beech. In either case, however, when we ascribe\\nsuch abilities to one another we have the impression that we are\\nmaking claims that, whether they are worth saying or not, are at least\\nsometimes true. The impression of truth exerts a pressure towards\\ngiving a philosophical theory of ability. It is not an option, at\\nleast at the outset, to dismiss all our talk of ability as fiction or\\noutright falsehood. A theory of ability can be reasonably expected to\\nsay what it is to have an ability in a way that vindicates the\\nappearance of truth. Such a theory will deserve the name\\n‘philosophical’ insofar as it gives an account, not of\\nthis or that range of abilities, but of abilities generally.  \\nabilities  \\nThis article falls into three parts. The first part, Sections 1 and 2,\\nstates a framework for discussing philosophical theories of ability.\\nSection 1 will say more about the distinction between abilities and\\nother powers of agents and objects. Section 2 will make some formal\\ndistinctions that are helpful for framing any theory of ability. The\\nsecond part, Sections 3 and 4, surveys theories of ability that have\\nbeen defended in the philosophical literature. Section 3 concerns the\\nmost prominent kind of theory, on which abilities are to be understood\\nin terms of a hypothetical relating an agent’s actions to her\\nvolitions. Section 4 concerns theories that are not hypothetical in\\nthis way. The third part, Section 5, turns to two significant\\napplications of a theory of ability. This section considers what role\\nsuch a theory can play in the free will debates and in giving an\\naccount of disability. Debates about free will often involve claims\\nabout agents’ abilities, and many have hoped that getting\\nclearer on abilities themselves could resolve, or at least shed light\\non, such debates. Similarly, some theorists of disability have hoped\\nthat appealing to the notion of ability can help explicate what it\\ntakes to have a disability. The aim of this last section will be to\\nassess whether these hopes are reasonable ones.  \\nEntry Contents Entry Contents  \\n1.

A taxonomy  \\nWhat an ability? On one reading, this question is a demand\\nfor a of ability of the sort described above. On\\nanother reading, however, this question simply asks for a rough guide\\nto what of things we are speaking of when we speak of\\n‘abilities’. So understood, this question is not asking\\nfor a theory of ability, but for an explanation of what exactly a\\ntheory of ability would be a theory . This section will\\noffer an answer to this question on this second, more modest,\\nreading.  \\nis  \\ntheory  \\nsort  \\nof  \\n1.1 Dispositions and other powers  \\nIt will be helpful to begin by considering a topic that is related to,\\nbut nominally distinct from, abilities: dispositions.  \\nDispositions are, at first pass, those properties picked out by\\npredicates like ‘is fragile’ or ‘is soluble’,\\nor alternatively by sentences of the form ‘ is\\ndisposed to break when struck’ or ‘ is disposed\\nto dissolve when placed in water.’ Dispositions so understood\\nhave figured centrally in the metaphysics and philosophy of science of\\nthe last century (Carnap 1936, 1937; Goodman 1954), and also in\\ninfluential accounts of the mind (Ryle 1949). They are like abilities\\nin many significant respects, in particular in the fact that they are\\nproperties of things that can exist even when not manifested: as a\\nglass may be fragile even when it is not broken, so may a person have\\nthe ability to raise her arm even when she is not raising her arm.  \\nx  \\nx  \\nWhile dispositions have been central to contemporary philosophical\\ndiscussions, they do not exhaust the range of the possibilities\\ninherent in things. Especially notable, for present purposes, are\\nthose that are intimately connected to agency. These include the\\nsusceptibility of things to be acted on in certain ways — such\\nas the edibility of an apple, or the walkability of a trail —\\nthat the psychologist J.J. Gibson called affordances (Gibson, 1979).\\nThese include also the powers of action that we ascribe to things, of\\nthe kind observed by Thomas Reid: ‘Thus we say, the wind blows,\\nthe sea rages, the sun rises and sets, bodies gravitate and\\nmove’ (Reid 1788/2010, 16; Reid himself regarded these locutions\\nas “misapplications” of active verbs, based on erroneous\\nviews of the grounds of powers). Finally, and crucially, these include\\nthe powers of agents themselves.  \\nIn light of this ontological diversity, it will be useful to have a\\nterm that encompasses all the possibilities inherent in things and in\\nagents. Let us reserve the word ‘power’ for that general\\nclass. Dispositions, as defined above, are a proper subset of powers\\nmore generally. Affordances, as sketched above, are another one. And\\nabilities, in a sense still to be defined, are yet another.  \\nIt may yet be that dispositions are especially privileged among the\\npowers. For instance, they might be more fundamental than the other\\npowers, in the sense that other powers may be reduced to them. It has\\nbeen proposed, for instance, that affordances may be reduced to\\ndispositions (Scarantino 2003). And we will consider in some detail,\\nin Section 3.4, the proposal that abilities themselves may be reduced\\nto dispositions. But our initial hypothesis is that dispositions are\\nsimply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has\\nreceived a great measure of attention in the philosophical\\nliterature.  \\n1.2 Demarcating abilities  \\nAbilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely,\\nis an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two\\nadditional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an\\nability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects.\\nAbilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not\\nagents. Objects have dispositions and affordances — as a glass\\nis disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid\\n— but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is\\nnot, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is\\nbecause agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second,\\nabilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate\\nagents to .  \\nactions  \\nSome examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some\\npowers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any\\nrelation to action. Consider the power of understanding language.\\nUnderstanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational,\\nis not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus\\nthe power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present\\ntaxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability,\\nsince it involves a relation to action. (See van Inwagen 1983,\\n8–13.)  \\nSo, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that\\nrelates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities,\\nwhile serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it\\ninherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between\\nactions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain\\nof action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem\\nthat, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible\\nthat the domain of action will be , so that there are\\nsome events that are not definitely actions, but that are not\\ndefinitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about\\naction apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is\\nright, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in\\nterms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and\\nvague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the\\ntheory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For\\ngiving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on\\nparadigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of\\nability.  \\nvague  \\nNote there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as\\ndistinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active\\npowers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the\\nwill (Reid 1788/2000). But it is not clear that these distinctions\\noverlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be\\nan active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability,\\nfor the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question\\nof whether willing is itself an action.  \\n1.3 Knowledge how and skill  \\nSome will expect an account of ability to also be an account of\\nknowledge how, on the supposition that one knows how to perform a\\ncertain action just in case one has the ability to perform that\\naction. This supposition, which we may call the Rylean account (since\\nit is most explicitly defended in Ryle 1949, 25–61), has been\\nchallenged by intellectualists about know how, notably Stanley and\\nWilliamson (2001). Intellectualists argue that knowing how to perform\\nan action is a matter of knowing a certain proposition. Stanley and\\nWilliamson’s account draws on observations about the standard\\ntreatment of embedded questions (‘know who’, ‘know\\nwhere’, and so forth; see Karttunen 1977) to defend this idea.\\nSpecifically, they propose that knowing how to is knowing\\nthat some way is a way for one to . On this view, then,\\nknowing how to is clearly not the same thing as having an\\nability to .  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nAuthors who reject the Rylean account may nonetheless wish to uphold\\none of two weaker Rylean theses. (It bears noting that Stanley and\\nWilliamson reject both.) First, one might defend the Sufficiency\\nThesis, which says that ability implies know how. The Sufficiency\\nthesis is incompatible with the intellectualist claim that know how\\nrequires knowledge of some proposition. Second, one might defend the\\nNecessity Thesis, according to which know how implies ability. The\\nNecessity Thesis is compatible with the view that know how requires\\n(in addition to ability) knowledge of a certain proposition.  \\nStill, also the Necessity Thesis has been challenged, often by appeal\\nto cases like the following (adapted from Stanley and Williamson\\n2001). Imagine a retired ski instructor who is no longer physically\\ncapable of descending the slopes. One might think that it is possible\\nfor the ski instructor to retain their knowledge how to ski even when\\nthey have lost their physical ability. Intuitively, they might still\\nbe able to impart their know how on others. This suggests that know\\nhow does not imply ability.  \\nA common way for defendants of the Necessity Thesis to respond to\\ncases like these is to say that whether know how implies ability\\ndepends on our understanding of ability. In particular, if it suffices\\nfor ability that one can perform an act succesfully in some (set of)\\nrelevant circumstances (where these circumstances need not actually\\nobtain), then there may be a sense in which the ski instructor in the\\nexample retains their ability to ski. It is ability in this sense, the\\nargument goes, that is implied by knowledge how (for further\\ndiscussion see Hawley 2003 and Cath 2019). Another response (developed\\nin Boylan 2024) is to propose that there are two different readings of\\nknow how claims. On one reading, know how entails ability; on another\\nit does not. The question then is whether any extant account of know\\nhow can explain both these readings.  \\nWhatever our view of ability’s relation to know how, there is a\\nfurther question at the intersection of these topics that bears\\nconsideration: how should we accommodate skills? Skillful action is\\noften thought to involve a cognitive component. This suggests that\\nhaving a skill is closely connected to having propositional knowledge.\\nIn line with this, some authors propose to adopt an intellectualist\\naccount of skill. For instance, Pavese and Beddor (2023) defend the\\nview that skills are propositional knowledge states. On this view,\\nknowledge how reduces to knowledge that, and having a skill to just is having knowledge how to . Therefore,\\nhaving a skill reduces to having knowledge of some proposition.  \\nA  \\nA  \\nAlternatively, one might suggest that having a skill is best\\nunderstood as having an ability that meets certain further conditions.\\nOne oft-mentioned condition that is thought to distinguish skills from\\nother abilities is that developing and maintaining a skill requires\\npractice (e.g., McGeer 2018; Robb 2020; Shepherd 2021; Fridland 2021).\\nAnother influential suggestion concerning what sets skills apart is\\nthat their exercise involves “strategic control” (Fridland\\n2014, 2021). This is to say that “skilled agents are able to\\nmodify, adjust and adapt their practical intentions in ways that are\\nappropriate, effective, and flexible given their overall goals”\\n(Fridland 2021, p. 5939). This view allows that knowledge of certain\\npropositions (e.g., ‘it is best to wait with ’ing given my circumstances’) plays an important\\nrole in skilled action, without suggesting that skill reduces to\\npropositional knowledge.  \\nA  \\nUltimately, accurately accounting for the nature of know how, skill,\\nand their relationship to abilities remains an open and intriguing\\nproblem. For further discussion of the relation between ability and\\nknow how, see the entry on .  \\nknowledge how  \\n2. Distinctions in ability  \\nIf one wants to give a theory of ability of the sort described at the\\noutset, it is helpful for that theory to observe some formal\\ndistinctions that have been marked in the literature. This section\\ncanvasses some of the most important distinctions.  \\n2.1 General and specific ability  \\nThe previous section was primarily concerned with distinguishing\\nabilities from other powers. But there is also a distinction to be\\nmade within the class of abilities itself. This is the distinction\\nbetween and abilities\\n(Honoré 1964; Mele 2003).  \\ngeneral  \\nspecific  \\nThe distinction between general and specific abilities may be brought\\nout by way of example. Consider a well-trained tennis player equipped\\nwith ball and racquet, standing at the service line. There is, as it\\nwere, nothing standing between her and a serve: every prerequisite for\\nher serving has been met. Such an agent is serve, or has serving as an . Let us say that such an\\nagent has the to serve.  \\nin a position to  \\noption  \\nspecific ability  \\nIn contrast, consider an otherwise similar tennis player who lacks a\\nracquet and ball, and is miles away from a tennis court. There is\\nclearly a good sense in which such an agent has the ability to hit a\\nserve: she has been trained to do so, and has done so many times in\\nthe past. Yet such an agent lacks the to\\nserve, as that term was just defined. Let us say that such an agent\\nhas the to serve.  \\nspecific ability  \\ngeneral ability  \\nThe concern of this article will be general abilities in this sense,\\nand unqualified references to ‘ability’ should be read in\\nthat way. But specific abilities will also be at issue. This is for at\\nleast two reasons.  \\nThe first is one of coverage: many of the proposals that are relevant\\nto the understanding of ability, especially the classical\\n‘conditional analysis’ (discussed in Section 3.1 below),\\nare naturally read as proposals about specific ability in the present\\nsense, and a suitably broad conception of ability lets us keep these\\nproposals within our domain of discussion.  \\nThe second reason is more properly philosophical. If we accept the\\ndistinction between general and specific abilities, then we want for\\nour account of ability to accommodate both of them, and ultimately to\\nexplain how they are related to each other. For this distinction is\\nnot plausibly diagnosed as mere ambiguity; it rather marks off\\nsomething like two modes of a single kind of power. There are at least\\ntwo kinds of proposals one may make here. One, arguably implicit in\\nmany of the ‘new dispositionalist’ approaches to ability\\n(§3.4), is that general ability is in some sense prior to\\nspecific ability: to have a specific ability is simply to have a\\ngeneral ability and to meet some further constraint, such as having an\\nopportunity. Another proposal (suggested in Maier 2015) is that\\nspecific ability is in some sense prior to general ability: to have a\\ngeneral ability is simply to have a specific ability under a certain\\nrange of circumstances.  \\nThe idea that there is some sort of bipartite distinction to be made\\nbetween abilities has been a prominent theme in contemporary work on\\nability. It has been endorsed and developed, in different contexts, by\\nWhittle (2010), Glick (2012) and Vihvelin (2013). However, the\\nbipartite distinctions introduced by these authors differ from one\\nanother in certain respects. How should we interpret this divergence?\\nIt could be that there exist bipartite distinctions\\nand that each proposed view tracks one of these. Alternatively, there\\nmight be a single distinction, so that only one of the classifications\\nintroduced by these (and other) authors tracks a genuine difference\\nbetween two modes of ability.  \\nseveral  \\n2.2 Further distinctions  \\nBesides the distinction between general and specific abilities,\\ntheorists of ability have proposed several further classifications. In\\nthis section, we discuss three of them. The first, developed by Simon\\nKittle (2015) differentiates and abilities. Kittle proposes that abilities can be thought of as\\n‘general’ in two different ways. On the one hand,\\nabilities can be general in the sense already outlined: these are\\nabilities that an agent may be said to possess even if she cannot\\nexercise them given her circumstances. On the other hand, abilities\\ncan be ‘general’ (we will henceforth use\\n‘global’ to avoid terminological confusion) in the sense\\nthat they can be exercised across a wide range of possible\\ncircumstances. Local abilities, in contrast, can be exercised in only\\na narrow range of circumstances.  \\nglobal  \\nlocal  \\nPlausibly, the distinction between global and local abilities\\nisn’t binary but indicative of a spectrum: general abilities may\\nbe more or less global. To see this, let us return to the example of\\nthe tennis player who has a general (but not a specific) ability to\\nserve. Suppose the tennis player is able to hit a serve only in\\nconditions particularly conducive to playing tennis (e.g., minimal\\nwind; access to a well-maintained court and racket; no distractions).\\nThe narrow range of conditions in which the agent can exercise her\\nability doesn’t make that ability specific. After all, the\\nconditions specified need not actually obtain. But it does make the\\nability local.  \\nAnother, arguably more basic distinction is that between and abilities. As Mele (2003)\\npoints out, there is a sense in which agents are able to do whatever\\nthey in fact do. For example, an agent who rolls a six with a fair die\\nwas able (in the simple sense) to do so. Yet there is also another\\nsense of ability which requires that the agent is, in some relevant\\nway, in control (though for a recent objection to the view that there\\nis such a sense of ability see Mandelkern 2024). Mele calls ability in\\nthis more controlled sense an intentional ability. How much control\\nover one’s performance is required to have an intentional\\nability is contentious. As in the case of the previous classification,\\none might think that the notions of ‘simple’ and\\n‘intentional’ ability indicate the existence of a gradient\\nrather than a strict binary distinction: agents may have more or less\\ncontrol over the performance of an act.  \\nsimple  \\nintentional  \\nA third distinction worth mentioning, drawn by Vihvelin (2013), is\\nthat between and abilities. Narrow\\nabilities are abilities that agents possess in virtue of their\\ninternal constitution. Thus, two intrinsic duplicates (governed by the\\nsame laws) have the same narrow abilities. In contrast, wide abilities\\nare abilities that agents possess in virtue of the combination of\\ntheir internal constitution and their surroundings. On first sight,\\nthe narrow/wide distinction might appear to coincide with the\\ndistinction between general and specific abilities. In each case, one\\ntype of ability is possessed only if the agent has the opportunity to\\nexercise it. However, Vihvelin proposes that an agent who lacks a\\nnarrow ability to at a given time may nevertheless have a\\ngeneral ability to . Such an agent may generally (at most\\nother times) possess the narrow ability to .  \\nnarrow  \\nwide  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nWhile many questions remain about the best way to carve up abilities,\\nit should be clear that distinctions between different types or senses\\nof ability are important not just in their own right, but also if we\\nwish to explicate certain other phenomena by appeal to abilities.\\nAbilities have been invoked to account for knowledge, concept\\npossession, free will, disability, and other phenomena. If agents can\\npossess more than one type of ability, or possess an ability in\\nvarious senses, then carefully specifying which type or sense is\\nrelevant will be crucial to appropriately account for these other\\nphenomena.  \\n3. Hypothetical theories of ability  \\nThe bulk of theories of ability that have been defended in the\\nhistorical and contemporary literature have been what we might call theories. On such views, to have an ability is\\nfor it to be the case that one act in certain ways if\\none were to have certain volitions. One arrives at different theories\\ndepending on how one understands the volitions in question and how\\nexactly these actions would hypothetically depend on them, but\\nnonetheless these views constitute something like a unified family.\\nGiven their prominence and unity, it is natural to begin our survey of\\ntheories of ability with them.  \\nhypothetical  \\nwould  \\n3.1 The conditional analysis  \\nThe most prominent hypothetical theory of ability is what has come to\\nbe called the ‘conditional analysis’. In what follows, we\\nwill survey that form of analysis, the problems for it, and\\nalternatives to it that are supposed to overcome those problems.  \\nThe conditional analysis of ability has at least two aspects. First, has an ability to just in case a certain\\nconditional is true of her. Second, that conditional has the following\\nform: would if were to have a certain\\nvolition. The precise form such an analysis will take will depend on,\\nfirst, how we interpret this conditional and, second, which volition\\nfigures in the antecedent.  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nIt has been standard in the literature, when this first question has\\nbeen raised, to understand the conditional as a conditional (Ginet 1980), and we will assume in what follows that this\\nis the best form of the conditional analysis. There has been some\\ndisagreement about whether it is a or a conditional that is relevant (for an account of this distinction, see\\nLewis 1973, 21–24), as well as about which volition is relevant.\\nIn the following, we will take the relevant conditional to be a conditional, and the relevant volition to be , though nothing will hang on these selections, and the\\npoints to be raised would apply also to other forms of conditional\\nanalysis, .  \\nsubjunctive  \\nmight  \\nwould  \\nwould  \\ntrying  \\nmutatis mutandis  \\nWe thus arrive at the following form of the conditional analysis:  \\n(CA)  \\nhas the ability to iff would if tried to .  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nIf (CA) were true, it would constitute a theory of ability in that it\\nwould say under exactly what conditions some agent has the ability to\\nperform some action without making reference to the idea of ability\\nitself.  \\nThe conditional analysis so understood has been subject to a fair\\namount of criticism, which will be reviewed in the following section.\\nIt bears noting, however, just how apt an account of ability it seems\\nat first pass. It satisfies, at least at first approximation, the\\nextensional constraints: there are many actions with respect to which\\na typical agent satisfies the relevant conditional, and also many\\nactions with respect to which she does not, and these roughly\\ncorrespond to her abilities. This imposes a demand even on those who\\nwish to reject (CA), namely to explain , if (CA) is simply\\nfalse, it so closely approximates to the truth about abilities.  \\nwhy  \\nIts approximate satisfaction of the extensional constraints is also\\nplausibly a reason why something like (CA) has found so many\\nthoughtful advocates. It is at least strongly suggested, for example,\\nby the following remarks from Hume’s :  \\nEnquiry  \\nFor what is meant by liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We\\ncannot surely mean that actions have so little connexion with motives,\\ninclinations, and circumstances, that one does not follow with a\\ncertain degree of uniformity from the other, and that one affords no\\ninference by which we can conclude the existence of the other. For\\nthese are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we\\ncan only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the\\ndeterminations of the will; this is, if we choose to remain at rest,\\nwe may; if we choose to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical\\nliberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a\\nprisoner and in chains. (8.1; Hume 1748, 72)  \\nOf course, Hume and many of those who have followed him have been\\nattempting to do something rather than to offer a theory\\nof ability. Hume’s intent was to show that disputes over\\n‘question of liberty and necessity, the most contentious\\nquestion of metaphysics’ have been ‘merely verbal’\\n(8.1; Hume 1748, 72). Whatever we may think of this striking claim,\\nhowever, there is a dialectical gap between it and the alleged truth\\nof (CA). To anticipate a theme that will be central in what follows,\\nwe must be careful to distinguish between, on the one hand, the\\nadequacy of various views of ability and, on the other, the more\\ncontentious metaphysical questions about freedom to which they are\\ndoubtlessly related. It is the former that will be our concern in this\\nsection.  \\nmore  \\n3.2 Problems for the conditional analysis  \\n(CA) says that satisfying a certain conditional is both sufficient and\\nnecessary for having a certain ability. There are two kinds of\\ncounterexamples that may be brought against (CA): counterexamples to\\nits sufficiency, and to its necessity. Let us take these in turn.  \\nCounterexamples to the of (CA) have been most\\nprominent in the literature. Informally, they are suggested by the\\nquestion: ‘but could try to ?’ There\\nare a variety of ways of translating this rhetorical question into a\\ncounterexample. We may distinguish two: global counterexamples,\\naccording to which (CA) might get the facts about\\nability wrong, and local counterexamples, according to which (CA)\\nmight get the facts about ability wrong.  \\nsufficiency  \\nS  \\nA  \\nalways  \\nsometimes  \\nBegin with global counterexamples. Let us say that is true at our world. Familiar arguments purport\\nto show that, if this is the case, then no one has the ability to do\\nanything, except perhaps for what she actually does. But if (CA) is\\ntrue, then agents would have the ability to perform various actions\\nthat they do not actually perform. This is a counterexample turning on\\nprecisely the kinds of contentious questions about free will and\\ndeterminism that, as indicated above, we are for the moment setting\\naside. (We will return to the issues purportedly raised by determinism\\nbelow in Section 5.1).  \\ndeterminism  \\nIt seems, however, that we can show that (CA) is false even relative\\nto premises that are shared between various disputants in the free\\nwill debates. This is what is shown by local counterexamples to (CA).\\nOne such example is given by Keith Lehrer:  \\nSuppose that I am offered a bowl of candy and in the bowl are small\\nround red sugar balls. I do not choose to take one of the red sugar\\nballs because I have a pathological aversion to such candy. (Perhaps\\nthey remind me of drops of blood and … ) It is logically\\nconsistent to suppose that if I had chosen to take the red sugar ball,\\nI would have taken one, but, not so choosing, I am utterly unable to\\ntouch one. (Lehrer 1968, 32)  \\nSuch an example shows that (CA) is false without assuming anything\\ncontentious in debates over freedom. It turns rather on a simple\\npoint: that psychological shortcomings, just as much as external\\nimpediments, may undermine abilities. (CA), which does not recognize\\nthis point, is therefore subject to counterexamples where such\\npsychological shortcomings become relevant. We may, if we like,\\ndistinguish ‘psychological’ from\\n‘non-psychological’ ability, and claim that (CA) correctly\\naccounts for the latter (this sort of strategy is suggested, for\\nexample, by Albritton 1985). But our ordinary notion of ability, that\\nof which we are attempting to give a theory, seems to involve psychological and non-psychological requirements. And if\\nthat is correct, then Lehrer’s example succeeds as a\\ncounterexample to (CA) as a theory of our ordinary notion of\\nability.  \\nboth  \\nCounterexamples to the of (CA) have been less\\nfrequently discussed (though see Wolf 1990), but they also raise\\nimportant issues about ability. Consider a case where a good golfer\\nmisses an easy putt. Given that this golfer tried to make the putt and\\nfailed to, it is false that she would have made the putt if she had\\ntried to; after all, she try it and did not make it. But,\\nas a good golfer, she presumably had the ability to make the putt. So\\nthis seems to be a case where one can have an ability without\\nsatisfying the relevant conditional, and hence a counterexample to the\\nnecessity of (CA).  \\nnecessity  \\ndid  \\nHere the defender of (CA) might avail herself of the distinction\\nbetween specific and general abilities. (CA), she might say, is an\\naccount of what it is to have a specific ability: that is, to actually\\nbe in a position to perform an action. The golfer lack\\nthis ability in this case, as (CA) correctly predicts. It is\\nnonetheless true that the golfer has the ability to\\nsink putts like this. But (CA) does not purport to be an analysis of\\ngeneral ability, and as such is compatible with the golfer having that\\nsort of ability (an approach very much like this is suggested in Locke\\n1962). Again, the plausibility of this response will hang on the\\nviability of the distinction between specific and general abilities.\\nAnd, whatever the merits of this response, the objection to the\\nsufficiency of (CA) remains.  \\ndoes  \\ngeneral  \\nWe appear to be at an impasse. On the one hand, the thought that\\nabilities are in some sense hypothetical is a deep and persistent\\ntheme in historical and contemporary work on ability. On the other\\nhand, the simplest development of this thought — the conditional\\nanalysis (CA) — appears to face obvious and well-known\\ncounterexamples both to its sufficiency and necessity, even when we\\nwaive the global counterexamples raised by determinism. Which way to\\ngo? We might reject the idea that abilities admit of a conditional\\nanalysis. Or we might give a somewhat more sophisticated conditional\\nanalysis.  \\n3.3 Sophisticated conditional accounts  \\nHow might the conditional analysis of ability be made more\\nsophisticated? Since the conditional analysis is a conditional that\\ninvolves a volition, there are at least two ways one might do this.\\nFirst, one might be more sophisticated about the nature of the\\nvolition: why do we focus on ? Second, one might be\\nmore sophisticated about the conditional: what precisely are the\\nsemantics of this conditional?  \\ntrying  \\nDonald Davidson takes the first way, and identifies the choice of\\nvolition in a traditional conditional analysis as the culprit:  \\nThe antecedent of a causal conditional that attempts to analyze\\n‘can’ or ‘could’ or ‘free to’ must\\nnot contain, as its dominant verb, a verb of action, or any verb which\\nmakes sense of the question, Can someone do ? (Davidson\\n1973, 68)  \\nit  \\nDavidson suggests that we may overcome this difficulty at least by\\nendorsing:  \\ncan do intentionally (under the description ) means that if has desires and beliefs that\\nrationalize (under ), then does . (Davidson 1973, 68)  \\nA  \\nx  \\nd  \\nA  \\nx  \\nd  \\nA  \\nx  \\nBut it is not clear that Davidson’s revision in fact answers\\nobjections to the sufficiency of the traditional conditional analysis.\\nFor these objections did not essentially depend on a verb of action\\nfiguring in the antecedent of the analyzing conditional. Consider\\nLehrer’s case again. It seems true that Lehrer’s imagined agent has desires and beliefs that\\nrationalized that action under the description ‘eating a red\\ncandy’—namely, adopting the analysis of Davidson 1963, a\\ndesire for a red candy and a belief that this action is a way of\\neating a red candy—she would eat a red candy. But the trouble is\\nprecisely that, in virtue of her psychological disability, she is\\nincapable of having this desire, and so cannot perform this action\\nintentionally. Davidson, the traditional objection to\\nthe conditional analysis seems to turn not on the specific volition\\nselected but rather on the very idea that ability is to be understood\\nin terms of a simple conditional dependence of action on the will.  \\nif  \\nPace  \\nThis brings us to a second way of responding, which is to suggest that\\nability instead involves a sophisticated conditional dependence of\\naction on the will. To begin to develop this kind of approach, we can\\nask: what kind of conditional is at issue in CA? Though this point is\\nnot always explicitly recognized, this conditional is a subjunctive or\\ncounterfactual conditional: it concerns what happen if\\nan agent to try. Much of the canonical literature on the\\nconditional analysis antedates adequate semantics theories of the\\ncounterfactual, notably the Stalnaker-Lewis semantics (Stalnaker,\\n1968; Lewis 1973). In this way, many of the authors in the tradition\\ndo not even have the formal resources to explore this second way of\\nresponding.  \\nwould  \\nwere  \\nOne recent work that addresses these formal questions is (Mandelkern\\net al. 2017). This discussion proposes an ‘act conditional\\nanalysis’ (ACA) on which an agent is able to perform\\nsome act just in case “there is some practically\\navailable action such that if tries to do it, she does ” (Mandelkern et al. 2017, 314). The (ACA) revises the\\nconditional analysis (CA) by introducing a layer of existential\\nquantification over modality, and introduces a welcome degree of\\nformal sophistication into the discussion of ability claims. For\\npresent purposes, however, it bears noting that the authors do not\\npropose to give a reductive account of what it is for an act to be\\n“practically available”, although this is an agentive and\\nindeed abilitative notion (Mandelkern et al. 2017, 318). In virtue of\\nwhat is choosing a candy practically available to me, but not to the\\nagent described by Lehrer? The authors do not purport to answer the\\nquestion, but in this sense their proposal remains incomplete as a\\ntheory of ability.  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nWhatever the prospects for this particular proposal, there is a\\nbroader methodological point here that ramifies well beyond (CA), and\\nindeed beyond the prospects for a conditional analysis of ability more\\ngenerally. Any account of abilities owes us, among other things, an\\naccount of ability-ascriptions. This is perhaps true of philosophical\\ntopics generally, but it is true or ability in particular. Even\\nphilosophers who are explicit in their “refusal to take language\\nas a starting point in the analysis of thought and modality”\\n(Lewis 1983, xi) are prone to make explicit appeal to language when\\nthe topic turns to ability, as occurs in (Lewis 1976) or (Taylor\\n1960). When it comes to ability, it is difficult to even identify the\\ntopic under consideration without using or mentioning certain phrases,\\nnotably ‘can’ and ‘is able to’.  \\nHappily, our understanding of such phrases is steadily improving.\\nWhile there has long been considerable philosophical interest in\\nexpressions such as ‘can’ and ‘is able to’,\\nthere is nothing recognizable as a rigorous semantic theory of such\\nterms prior to the foundational work of Angelika Kratzer, recently\\nrevised and collected in (Kratzer 2012). Kratzer’s work has been\\ncentral to natural language semantics, and its significance for\\nphilosophical work is still being appreciated. We address the question\\nof whether Kratzer’s semantics might inform a theory of ability\\nin Section 4, where we consider the modal analysis of ability. Here we\\nsimply note that the question of whether Kratzer’s account is\\ncorrect as a theory of agentive modals remains an open one. Any\\nadequate account of ability can be expected to give an account of\\nability ascriptions, and therefore needs to attend to this ongoing\\ndebate in the semantics of modal expressions.  \\n3.4 Alternative hypothetical accounts  \\nIf we reject a conditional analysis of ability, we might still give an\\naccount of ability that is broadly ‘hypothetical’ in\\nHume’s sense. The guiding idea of hypothetical accounts of\\nability is that there is a certain internal relationship between\\nability and volition, and that this relationship involves a certain\\nkind of dependence. The guiding idea, we might say, is that what it is\\nto have an ability to is for one’s ’ing to depend mostly or entirely on one’s\\nvolitions with respect to . The conditional analysis (CA)\\nformalizes this insight in a simple way, but it is not the only way in\\nwhich this might be done.  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nSeveral authors have revisited the thought that we may give a broadly\\nhypothetical account of ability, without endorsing the problematic\\nclaim (CA). This is the view of ability that has been defended by\\nSmith (2003), Vihvelin (2004, 2013), and Fara (2008). Following Clarke\\n(2009), we may label this view as the “new\\ndispositionalism”.  \\nWhat unifies the new dispositionalists is that they return to the\\nconditional analysis of ability in light of two thoughts. The first\\nthought is one already noted: that there is a variety of power,\\ndispositions, that is similar in many respects to abilities. The\\nsecond thought is that there are well-known problems of giving a\\nconditional analysis of dispositions, in light of which many authors\\nhave been inclined to reject the long-assumed link between\\ndispositions and conditionals. Taken together, these thoughts yield a\\npromising new line on abilities: that though we ought to reject the\\nconditional analysis of abilities, we may yet defend a dispositional\\naccount of abilities.  \\nWhy ought we reject the conditional analysis of dispositions? Consider\\nthe following analysis of the disposition to break when struck:  \\n(CD)  \\nis disposed to break when struck iff would\\nbreak if were struck.  \\nx  \\nx  \\nx  \\nDespite the intuitive appeal of (CD), there appear to be at least two\\nkinds of counterexamples to it. First, consider a crystal glass that,\\nif it were about to be struck, would transform into steel. This glass\\nis disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would\\nbreak if struck — the transformation renders this false. This is\\na case of finking, in the language of Martin (1994). Second, consider\\na crystal glass stuffed with styrofoam packaging. This glass is\\ndisposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would break\\nif struck — the packaging prevents this. This is a case of\\nmasking, in the language of Johnston (1992). In light of such cases,\\nit seems we ought to reject (CD).  \\nThe bearing of these points on our earlier discussion of the\\nconditional analysis is the following. There appear to be quite\\ngeneral problems for giving a conditional analysis of powers. So it\\nmay be that the failures of the conditional analysis of ability were\\nnot due to any fact about abilities, but rather to a shortcoming of\\nconditional analyses generally. One way of overcoming this problem, if\\nthis diagnosis is correct, is to analyze abilities directly in terms\\nof dispositions.  \\nSuch an analysis is proposed by Fara (2008), who argues:  \\nhas the ability to in circumstances iff she has the disposition to when, in circumstances , she tries to . (Fara 2008, 848)  \\nS  \\nA  \\nC  \\nA  \\nC  \\nA  \\nThe similarity of this analysis to the conditional analysis (CA) is\\nclear. (Note that other new dispositionalists, notably Vihvelin and\\nSmith, are sympathetic with the idea that conditionals do in the end\\nhave a central if complicated role to play in the analysis of\\ndispositions, so their departure from (CA) is in a way less radical\\nthan Fara’s.) This raises several immediate questions, such as\\nwhether this analysis can overcome the problem of sufficiency that\\nplagued those approaches (see Fara 2008, 851–852 for an\\naffirmative answer, and Clarke 2009, 334–336 for some doubts).\\nBut a larger question looms, which is whether the abilities of agents\\ncan indeed be analogized to the dispositions of objects.  \\nOne way of bringing out what is missing is by appeal to the idea that\\nthere seems to be a connection between my abilities, in the sense of\\nability that is relevant to free will, and what is up to me. Clarke\\nclaims that this sort of connection fails on the new dispositionalist\\nview of ability:  \\nAlthough the presence of a fink or mask that would prevent one’s ing is compatible with having a general capacity (the\\nunimpaired competence to ), there is an ordinary sense in\\nwhich in such circumstances an agent might well be unable to …. If there is something in place that would prevent\\nme from ing should I try to , if it is not up to\\nme that it would so prevent me, and it it is not up to me that such a\\nthing is in place, then even if I have a capacity to , it is\\nnot up to me whether I exercise that capacity. (Clarke 2009, 339)  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nThus the objection is that, while the new dispositionalist has perhaps\\noffered a theory of something, it is not a theory of ability.  \\nHow should the new dispositionalist respond? One thought is that we\\nare here again encountering the distinction between general and\\nspecific abilities. The new dispositionalist might contend that, while\\nthe agent described by Clarke lacks the specific ability to do\\notherwise, she has the general ability to do otherwise, and that it is\\nthis general ability of which the new dispositionalist is giving an\\naccount.  \\nOther important recent work has pursued the resources for a broadly\\nhypothetical account of ability in new ways. Notable here is (Jaster\\n2020), who defends a “success view” of abilities, which in\\na simplified version holds:  \\nhas an agentive ability to if and only if ’s in a sufficiently high proportion of the\\nrelevant possible situations in which she intends to .  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nA  \\nJaster’s analysis is non-conditional but is nonetheless\\nhypothetical in the broader sense suggested here. It does not identify\\nabilities with dispositions, though it shares formal features with\\ncertain treatments of disposition ascriptions, notably, as Jaster\\nnotes, that of (Manley and Wasserman 2008). Along with the other work\\ncited above, it suggests that the development of some kind of broadly\\nhypothetical analysis of ability remains a lively and open research\\nprogram.  \\n4. Non-hypothetical theories of ability  \\nA second broad family of theories of ability is . Proponents of non-hypothetical accounts\\nreject the idea that ability is best characterized in terms of a link\\nbetween an agent’s volitions and actions. The most established\\nnon-hypothetical account, especially within the logic and linguistics\\nliterature, is the of ability. According to\\nthe modal analysis, ability claims are possibility claims: claims\\nabout what an agent does in some non-actual state of affairs (or\\n‘possible world’). We discuss the modal analysis and some\\nof the challenges it faces in detail below. Besides the modal\\nanalysis, there is a further class of non-hypothetical theories that\\nhas come to receive increasing attention. Theories in this class\\ndiffer from the modal analysis in that they do not take ability to be\\nstraightforwardly analysable in terms of what an agent does in some\\nother possible world. We turn to this new class of non-hypothetical\\nanalyses in §4.4.  \\nnon-hypothetical  \\nmodal analysis  \\n4.1 The modal analysis  \\nIntuitively, claims about ability are tightly connected to claims\\nabout possibility. It is in some sense a truism that someone is able\\nto perform some act just in case it is possible for her to perform\\nit.  \\nTo develop this purported truism, begin with the thought that for to have an ability to it is necessary, but not\\nsufficient, that it be possible that does . This\\nclaim will be contentious for various more specialized sorts of\\npossibility, such as possibility or possibility. But if we may help ourselves to the idea of possibility (‘metaphysical possibility’), then\\nthis claim appears plausible. (We will survey some challenges to it\\nbelow in Section 4.2.) In contrast, it seems implausible that this\\nsort of possibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of\\nacts that that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent\\nmight nonetheless not be able to perform.  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nnomic  \\npractical  \\nsimpliciter  \\nThis suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability to is for it to be possible to in some sense of possibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to\\nthe laws of nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative\\nto what an agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some\\nindependently specifiable set of conditions.  \\nA  \\nA  \\nrestricted  \\nTo render this hypothesis precisely, we may employ the formal\\nframework of ‘possible worlds,’ which offers an elegant\\nand powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework, a\\nproposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible\\nworld. We can then say an agent is able to just in case she ’s at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some\\nindependently specifiable set of conditions.  \\nA  \\nA  \\nWe thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability:  \\n(MA)  \\nhas the ability to iff does at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition .  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nC  \\n(MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a\\ngeneral family of analyses. Different members of this family will be\\ndistinguished by the different candidates they might propose for , as well as whether they quantify over individual worlds or\\nsets of worlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient\\ntheoretical unity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of\\nabstraction, as a single approach to the analysis of ability.  \\nC  \\nTwo points about (MA) bear noting. First, sometimes\\n‘modal’ is used loosely to describe phenomena that are\\nconnected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. The\\nproponent of (MA) is concerned with modality in a stricter sense: she\\nproposes that ability may be analyzed in terms of the precise\\nframework of propositions and possible worlds just adumbrated. The\\nopponent of (MA), in turn, grants that ability has something to do\\nwith possibility but denies that any such analysis succeeds.  \\nSecond, while (MA) has been presented as an alternative to (CA), (CA)\\nis arguably just one particular version of (MA). For, as noted above,\\n(CA) appeals to a subjunctive conditional, and the standard semantics\\nfor the subjunctive conditional (developed in slightly different ways\\nin Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973) involve quantification over possible\\nworlds. Specifically, (on Stalnaker’s version) a subjunctive\\nconditional is true just in case its consequent is true at the world\\nwhere its antecedent is true that is otherwise maximally similar to\\nthe actual world. In these terms, (CA) is roughly equivalent to the\\nfollowing:  \\n(CA )  \\nmodal  \\nhas the ability to iff does at a world at which tries to that is\\notherwise maximally similar to the actual world.  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nThis is patently a version of (MA), with ‘ tries to and is otherwise maximally similar to the actual\\nworld’ serving as condition .  \\nS  \\nA  \\nC  \\nIf this is correct, then most discussions of the analysis of ability\\nin the twentieth century have focused on a special and somewhat\\nidiosyncratic case of a much broader program of analysis, namely the\\nprogram of giving a modal analysis of ability. The considerations\\nbrought forth in the remainder of this section, in contrast, are\\nconcerned with the general case.  \\n4.2 The modal analysis: extensional adequacy  \\nThere are two questions that might be raised for this proposal about\\nability. First, does ability indeed admit of some kind of modal\\nanalysis? Second, if it does, how exactly are we to spell out the\\ndetails of that analysis — in particular, how are we to\\narticulate condition C? Let us begin with the first, more basic,\\nquestion.  \\nAccording to (MA), performing an act at some possible world (or set of\\nworlds) is both necessary and sufficient for having the ability to\\nperform that act. One way of challenging this claim is to deny the\\nnecessity claim: that is, to argue that it is sometimes the case that\\nan agent is able to perform an act that she does not perform at any\\npossible world.  \\nThis is an argument that has in fact been made by several authors.\\nDescartes, for one, appears to have argued that God is such an agent\\n(Curley 1984). A genuinely omnipotent being, one might argue, should\\nbe able to perform any act whatsoever, even the impossible ones. This\\nview of omnipotence is contentious, but it is not clear that it should\\nbe ruled out formally, by the very analysis of ability, as (MA) does.\\nSpencer (2017) argues that even non-omnipotent agents may sometimes\\nhave the ability to perform acts that they do not perform at any\\npossible world.  \\nLet us grant, however, that the possibility of performing an act is a\\nnecessary condition for performing that act, and that in this sense an\\nattribution of ability entails a possibility claim. Another way to\\nobject to (MA) would be to challenge the sufficiency claim.\\nSpecifically, one might question whether there is any specification of such that every agent who does at a world (or\\nset of worlds) that satisfies is able to . Before\\naddressing this question, let us briefly review some proposed\\narticulations of .  \\nC  \\nA  \\nC  \\nA  \\nC  \\nTo begin with, one might suggest that what an agent is able to do just\\nis what is possible for her to do relative to the past and the laws of\\nnature (van Inwagen 1983), or else what is possible relative to all\\nagential-level facts (but not all physical-level facts) (List 2014).\\nIn each case, condition specifies that relevant worlds\\nshare some of their features with the actual world. Note that the\\nabove specifications aim to capture in the first place what it takes\\nto have a specific ability. General ability would seem to require a\\nrather different analysis.  \\nC  \\nAlternatively, on a seminal account introduced by Lewis (1976) and\\nrefined in Kratzer’s treatment of ‘can’ (1977, 1981,\\n2012), is contextually determined. This is to say that\\nwhether a statement of the form ‘ has the ability to ’ is true depends on the context in which it is made.\\nTo illustrate this point, consider the following example. Suppose that\\nit is possible for Jane to ride her bike given various stable facts\\nabout her internal constitution, but not given the fact that her bike\\nwas stolen. On the contextualist specification of (MA), whether these\\nfacts about Jane and her environment suffice to say that she has the\\nability to ride her bike depends on the precise fact about Jane the\\nability claim is meant to pick out. In some contexts, we are concerned\\nwith what Jane is able to do (almost) precisely as things stand. In\\nothers, we care about what she can do quite generally, independently\\nof whether she has access to the right resources. Condition differs depending on these interests. An advantage of this approach is\\nthat it can be employed to provide truth conditions for general and\\nspecific ability claims alike.  \\nC  \\nS  \\nA  \\nC  \\nRegardless of its appeal as a semantics for ability ascriptions, one\\nmight be skeptical of the promise of this contextualist version of\\n(MA) as an analysis of ability in the material mode. In particular,\\nwhile it may seem plausible that ability claims expressed in different\\ncontexts track different features of an agent, one might think it plausible that an agent’s possession of abilities\\nassociated with those features depends, metaphysically speaking, on\\nthe interests of speakers in some context.  \\nim  \\nReturning now to whether (MA) provides a sufficient condition for\\nability, some theorists have argued that there is no possible\\nspecification of such that every agent who s at a world that satisfies is able to . For instance, Schwarz (2020, see also Willer 2021)\\nproposes that no particular specification of guarantees\\nthat the agent’s ing is, in the right way, under their\\ncontrol. Put differently, it being possible (relative to some set of\\nfacts) that an agent ’s doesn’t seem to ensure\\nthat the agent can actively bring it about that they .  \\nC  \\nA’  \\nC  \\nA  \\nC  \\nA  \\nA  \\nA  \\nSince there are countless possible specifications of ,\\nshowing definitively that (MA) cannot provide a sufficient condition\\nfor ability is a difficult task. Still, the objection points to a\\nbroader concern: we can specify such that\\n(MA) delivers a sufficient condition for ability, it remains to be\\nseen whether this can be achieved without appeal to some other\\nagentive modal notion in the process (for discussion see Maier 2015).\\nSuppose, for example, that for (MA) to specify a sufficient condition,\\nthe relevant restriction can only be formulated as follows: ‘for to be able to is for it to be possible that ’s relative to what is within ’s power to do’. Since this version of (MA)\\nappeals to the ability-adjacent notion of what is within an\\nagent’s power to do, it arguably fails to provide a reductive\\nanalysis of ability in terms of ’s ing at\\nsome (set of) possible world(s).  \\nC  \\neven if  \\nC  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nS  \\nA'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Abilities', 'Header 3': '4.3 The modal analysis: logical considerations'}, page_content='A different way to resist the view that ability admits of a modal\\nanalysis is developed in a prescient discussion by Anthony Kenny\\n(Kenny 1975; the presentation of Kenny here is indebted to the\\ndiscussion in Brown 1988). Kenny argues that, if something like (MA)\\nis indeed true, then ability should obey the principles that govern\\nthe possibility operator in standard modal logics. Kenny claims that\\nability fails to satisfy the following two principles:  \\n(1)  \\n\\\\(A \\\\to \\\\Diamond A.\\\\)  \\nInformally, (1) expresses the principle that if an agent performs an\\naction, then she has the ability to perform this action. This is,\\nKenny argues, false of ability.  \\n(2)  \\n\\\\(\\\\Diamond(A \\\\lor B) \\\\to (\\\\Diamond A \\\\lor \\\\Diamond B).\\\\)  \\nInformally, (2) expresses the principle that if an agent has the\\nability to perform one of two actions, then she has the ability to\\nperform either the first action or the second action. This is, Kenny\\nargues, false of ability.  \\nLet us begin with (1). Kenny claims that this principle is false in\\nlight of cases like the following: ‘A hopeless darts player may,\\nonce in a lifetime, hit the bull, but be unable to repeat the\\nperformance because he does not have the ability to hit the\\nbull’ (Kenny 1975, 136). This kind of ‘fluky\\nsuccess’ has been extensively discussed in the philosophical\\nliterature — perhaps most famously in Austin (1956) — in\\norder to make a variety of points. Kenny’s insight is to observe\\nthat these simple cases tell against the modal analysis of ability, as\\nthey violate an axiom of many modal logics, namely any system as\\nstrong as the system (for an introduction to\\nvarious systems and their axioms, see the entry on ).  \\nT  \\nmodal logic  \\nA simple response to this point is to deny that (or\\nany stronger logic) is the correct logic for ability. To deny this is\\nstill to allow for a treatment of ability within the framework of\\npossible worlds. Notably, the modal logic is one\\nthat fails to validate (1). A natural response to Kenny’s first\\npoint, then, is to say that , rather than or some stronger system, is the correct modal logic\\nof ability.  \\nT  \\nK  \\nK  \\nT  \\nThis response is not available, however, in response to Kenny’s\\nsecond objection. Recall that objection was that (2) is true of\\npossibility but not of ability. Here the retreat to weaker modal\\nlogics will not work, since (2) is provable on the weakest standard\\nmodal logic, namely . Yet the parallel claim does\\nnot seem true of ability. Kenny gives the following example:  \\nK  \\nGiven a pack of cards, I have the ability to pick out on request a\\ncard which is either black or red; but I don’t have the ability\\nto pick out a red card on request nor the ability to pick out a black\\ncard on request. (Kenny 1975, 137)  \\nThis then appears to be a case where has the ability to or but lacks the ability to and lacks\\nthe ability to . So it appears that (2) is false of ability.\\nIn light of this Kenny concludes that ‘if we regard possible\\nworlds semantics as making explicit what is involved in being a\\npossibility, we must say that ability is not any kind of\\npossibility’ (Kenny 1975, 140).  \\nS  \\nA  \\nB  \\nA  \\nB  \\nTo appreciate Kenny’s conclusion, it is instructive to work\\nthrough why precisely this is a counterexample to (MA). Consider an\\nagent who has the ability to pick a red card or a black\\ncard, but does not have the ability to pick a red card or the ability\\nto pick a black card. According to (MA), has the ability to iff does at some world (or set of\\nworlds) satisfying condition . Consider the case where (MA)\\nappeals to a single world, not a set of worlds. If has the\\nability to pick a red card or pick a black card, then by (MA) there is\\na world satisfying condition where picks a red card or black card. Then either picks a red\\ncard at or picks a black card at .\\nThen, applying (MA) now in the other direction, has the\\nability to pick a red card or has the ability to pick a\\nblack card. But that, by assumption, is not the case. Since (MA) is\\nthe only substantive premise appealed to that argument, (MA) must be\\nrejected.  \\nS  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nC  \\nS  \\nw  \\nC  \\nS  \\nS  \\nw  \\nS  \\nw  \\nS  \\nS  \\nNote that this argument turned essentially on adopting the version of\\n(MA) which appeals to a single world, rather than a set of worlds. So\\none way of responding to this objection is by appealing to sets of\\nworlds in the modal analysis of ability. Modal accounts that appeal to\\nsets of worlds are ‘non-normal’ in the sense that they do\\nnot satisfy the axiom , but they remain true to the\\nletter of (MA) as well as the spirit of modal analyses generally,\\ninsofar as they avail themselves only of possible worlds and\\nquantification thereover. This type of view has been proposed by Mark\\nBrown, who argues that, if we take accessibility relations to hold\\nbetween a world and a set of worlds, then we may capture talk of\\nability within a possible worlds framework that is broadly in the\\nspirit of standard views (Brown 1988; for recent proposals along these\\nlines see Kikkert 2022; Storrs-Fox 2023). Views of this type aim to\\ncapture that not just any instance of ’s ing\\nentails that was able to . Instead, an agent must\\nsucceed reliably enough across certain nearby worlds for their ing to count as sufficiently controlled.  \\nK  \\nS  \\nA  \\nS  \\nA  \\nA  \\nAlternatively, we may take this point to militate in favor of a return\\nto hypothetical theories of ability, since, at least on Lewis’s\\nview of subjunctive conditionals, it may be that a disjunction follows\\nfrom a counterfactual claim without either of its disjuncts following\\nfrom that claim (Lewis 1973, 79–80).  \\n4.4 Alternative non-hypothetical accounts  \\nThe foregoing has indicated serious concerns about the adequacy of two\\northodox approaches to ability: the conditional analysis (CA), and the\\nmodal analysis (MA), of which (CA) is arguably just a special case.\\nThis raises the question of what a non-hypothetical and non-modal\\naccount of ability and its attribution might look like.  \\nSince abilities are a kind of power, one natural idea is to analyze\\nability in terms of some better understood power. As we have seen in\\nSection 3.4, this is the route the new dispositionalist takes when she\\nproposes to analyze abilities in terms of dispositions. However, where\\nthe new dispositionalist subsequently gives a hypothetical account of\\ndispositions, proponents of other power-based views characterize the\\ntype of power in terms of which they analyze ability in a\\nnon-hypothetical manner.  \\nA first non-hypothetical analysis of ability as a kind of power can be\\nfound in the work of Barbara Vetter (2013, 2015). On Vetter’s\\nview, to have an ability is to have a certain kind of . Both agents and objects may possess\\npotentialities, and their possession of these potentialities is more\\nfundamental, metaphysically speaking, than what goes on at other\\npossible worlds. Unlike traditional dispositions, which involve a\\ndyadic relation between a stimulus and a manifestation (for example: a\\nglass is disposed to break when struck), potentialities involve a\\nmonadic relation to a manifestation (for example: a glass has the\\npotential to break). On first sight, this makes potentiality\\nwell-suited to account for ability. Abilities, like potentialities,\\nappear to involve a monadic relation to an act (e.g., I am able to ). One challenge for this view is that Vetter\\ntakes potentialities to obey the principles of possibility that caused\\ntrouble for (MA) (see §4.3). This means that an explanation of\\nwhy ability violates these principles must be sought outside of its\\nbeing a kind of potentiality.  \\npotentiality  \\nplay tennis  \\nA different power-based view is suggested by Helen Steward, whose work\\nemphasizes the traditional notion of a “two-way power”\\n(Steward 2012, 2020; see also Alvarez 2013). Steward argues that\\nactions are exercises of two-way powers— “powers which an\\nagent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all prior\\nconditions at that moment fixed” (Steward 2020, 345). These are\\nto be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest whenever their\\nmanifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile glass that breaks\\nwhenever it is struck. Unlike the new dispositionalists on the one\\nhand and Vetter on the other, Steward sees a fundamental asymmetry\\nbetween agents, who are bearers of two-way powers, and mere objects,\\nwho are bearers only of one-way powers. It is natural then to think\\nthat what it is to have an ability is to have a two-way power of a\\ncertain kind, and that a theory of ability should follow from an\\naccount of agency in terms of two-way powers.  \\nStill other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting\\nalso the thought that having an ability is having some other kind of\\npower — be it a disposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power.\\nOne such account is developed by John Maier (2018, 2022), who argues\\nthat ability is best understood in terms of options. Roughly, options\\nare those acts that are open to an agent at a given time. Importantly,\\nwhat it takes for an action to be open to an agent is not further\\nanalyzable in terms of quantification over possible worlds. To have a\\ngeneral ability, according to Maier, just is to have a particular\\npattern of options. This view thereby runs counter to many other\\naccounts of ability, including new dispositionalist views and\\nVetter’s potentiality-based account, which take general\\nabilities to be fundamental.  \\nFinally, a fourth type of non-hypothetical account might be gleaned\\nfrom Lewis’ posthumously published compatibilist account of\\nabilities. Lewis’ analysis, roughly, is that has the\\nability to perform an action just in case there is some\\nbasic action, , such that (i) doing would\\nconstitute doing , and (ii) there is no obstacle to ’s doing . The problem of giving a theory of\\nability then becomes the problem of giving a theory of obstacles,\\nsomething at which Lewis, in his outline, makes a beginning (see\\nBeebee et al. 2020 for further discussion).  \\nS  \\nA  \\nB  \\nB  \\nA  \\nS  \\nB  \\nIt is something of an open question whether on this proposal,\\nultimately, facts about abilities reduce to facts about what happens\\nat other possible worlds. What clear is that this\\nproposal, if it can be understood as a form of (MA) at all, would\\nconstitute a significantly more complex modal analysis than that\\nsuggested by Lewis in earlier work (1976). Lewis’ proposal is an\\ninspiration for further research in at least two ways. First, it\\nindicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the\\nproblem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding\\nproject. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches\\nremain available and the project of giving an analysis of ability may\\nyet be in its early stages.  \\nis  \\n5. Applying the theory of ability  \\nThus far our questions about abilities have been formal ones: we have\\nbeen asking what it is to have an ability, without concerning\\nourselves with the substantive work that a theory of ability might\\nhave to do. But abilities are in fact central to a range of\\nphilosophical topics. Let us therefore consider some applications of a\\ntheory of abilitiy.')]"
